# SyncTAK

An SyncTAK is a software compilibility layer for the Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK) that allows multiple ATAK devices to share data using Syncprotocol P2P protocol, which have backend as FCM (And other push messaging technologies) 

## Features

- No Radio Needed: The only thing you need to communicate is just Internet connection! (This app uses ![FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging?hl=ko) to communicate)
- Military-Grade AES-256-CBC (PKCS5Padding) then HMAC-SHA-256 Encryption
- Abbreviate & Non-Abbreviate COT Switch
- Communication Groupping with Muilitple Profile (Communication possible only between groups of the same group: extension of FCMâ€™s Topic function)
- Custom Third-party network provider (To enable CoT communication using a personal XMPP/MQTT server easily without developing complex ATAK plugins)
